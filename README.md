#### About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a concentration in Machine Intelligence in 2021 as well as with a Master of Science in Engineering on the Engineering Management track in 2022. 

Here are some of my interests:

 - Machine Learning with Keras and Tensorflow
 - Artificial Intelligence 
 - CNNs and Deep Learning 
 - Simulation in R and MATLAB
 - Ethical Hacking with Kali Linux
 - Docker
 - VMs
 - Fullstack Development
 - App Development
 - Game Development
 - Sorting Algorithms
 - Emulation

I have little to barely any experience or knowledge with any of these topics. These are all topics that I've found very interesting and intruiging, but I've never really given myself the time to explore or study these. I want this GitHub to document my exploration of these topics through different personal research and projects.

On that note, these are some of the projects I have worked on over the years, mostly during my coursework:
 - [Computer vision project that classifies whether someone is sad, neutral, or upset based on their facial expression](https://github.com/brubio5171/computer_vision_project)
 - [Was part of a group where we worked on a program designed to drive interest in children to learn to code](https://github.com/dylang1720/KidsWhoKodeGroup)
 - [Data Wrangling project where I analyzed a data set that listed hotspots where cities near industrial facilities where facing higher levels of cancer-causing emissions](https://github.com/brubio5171/data-wrangling-project)

I hope to add more and growingly complex projects to my roster.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. Here's a picture of my dog as a reward:
